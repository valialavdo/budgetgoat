### 1. Download Firebase Config Files
After creating your Firebase project, download these files and place them in your project root:

**For iOS:**
- Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` from Firebase Console
- Place it in `/Users/valialavdogianni/budget-planner/GoogleService-Info.plist`

**For Android:**
- Download `google-services.json` from Firebase Console  
- Place it in `/Users/valialavdogianni/budget-planner/google-services.json`

### 2. Create Development Build

**For iOS Simulator:**
```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

**For Android Emulator:**
```bash
npx expo run:android
```

### 3. Test Firebase Integration

Once the development build is running:

1. **Test Authentication**
   - Try signing up with a new email
   - Try signing in with existing email
   - Check Firebase Console â†’ Authentication to see users

2. **Test Data Creation**
   - Create a new pocket
   - Add a transaction
   - Check Firebase Console â†’ Firestore to see data

3. **Test Real-time Updates**
   - Create data on one device
   - Check if it appears on another device/session

### 4. Troubleshooting

**If you get Firebase errors:**
- Make sure config files are in the correct location
- Check that bundle ID matches Firebase project settings
- Verify Firestore security rules are set correctly

**If development build fails:**
- Make sure you have Xcode/Android Studio installed
- Check that simulators/emulators are running
- Try clearing cache: `npx expo start --clear`
